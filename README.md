# laptop_price_prediction_ml
It's a Machine Learning Project which can predict about the price of the Laptop when you provide your required configuration
What I did in this project is, I created a laptop price prediction, 
it's a regression project.
The data set which I used for this project is available over kaggle 
& here's the link --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price
You can download this dataSet and apply EDA and feature engineering according to your knowledge else I did the most best which we can get from this small dataSet.

I used Random Forest for the ml model creation & the R2 score I'll got is around 0.8656
so overall its a good R2 score if we see this that the dataSet is not that huge.
The Prediction I am getting is also overall good & justable, you just need to have a good knowledge of python and machine learning if you want to do this project
you can easily did this.

Main libraries -->
skLearn 
Stremlit

skLearn is used to for the ml model creation and the Streamlit is to create a good looking and simple frontend
and other libraries used in this project are Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, & other pyhton libraries as well..
